# Code Breaker
Do you think you have what it takes to crack the code? Can you guess the secret number in the correct amount of guesses? Test your brain and your logical side by playing this Code Breaker game.

## Motivation
Welcome to my first passion project game. In the past, I have made two games, both of which were meant for school projects. As someone who loves video games, it was only a matter of time that I was going to start building my own games. I wanted to start with something simple, yet fun. A very classic puzzle in a majority of video games is a Code Breaker mini-game where players have to guess the code to unlock something. These codes can be seen on padlocks to doors, treasure chests, suitcases, you name it.

I, personally, love these types of mini-games, so I wanted to dedicate a whole game to them. Some versions of the Code Breaker game have clues written on notes that players are meant to find in a map, others have placement clues to show what number or letter goes in a cerain spot, and others have color coded indicators to show the player which guesses are in the correct spaces.

## How To Play
In the most vanilla version of the game, players will have 10 attempts to guess the secret 4-digit code correctly. If they are not able to guess the secret code by the end of the 10th guess, then the player will lose and be presented with a "Game Over" screen.

There will be arrows on the top and bottom of the guessed number that players will have to click in order to change the digit for that column. Since I am going for a Code Breaker game that represents a padlock, players will not be able to key-in their guess and must "rotate" the column to their expected guess.

## Future Development
In the future, after the vanilla version of the game is released, I do plan on adding extra game modes.
- Easy Mode (2-3 digit secret code)
- Hard Mode (5-6 digit secret code)
- Extra Hard Mode (7+ digit secret code)
- Keypad mode (No up and down arrows, click buttons on a frontend keypad or key-in numbers on keyboard)

These are just a few different modes I had in mind and have no official release date of when they will be present for the public.
